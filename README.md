## Requirement
Create a MySQL database. 
Create 3 tables in the database, with a minimum of three columns each.
Add 15 rows of data to each table.
Export your database.
Create a new repository in Git. Upload your SQL file to it.
Iâ€™m going to be pulling down all of your SQL files, and seeing if I can create a database by importing them. 
If you want to double check that your file works, drop your database, and import using your SQL file.
In another file that you upload to GitHub, write 3 queries that can be run on your database and will return specific information.
